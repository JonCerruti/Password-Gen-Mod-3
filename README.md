# How the page works

Once the page is opened you will click on the Generate Password button. When the button clicks you will choose a character count between 8 and 128 characters. Next you will be asked if you would like uppercase characters follwed by lowercase, numbers, and finally special characters. As long as at least one of those options were chosen you will get a random string of that/those character types. This will display on the webpage in the box that starts with the text "Your Secure Password"
